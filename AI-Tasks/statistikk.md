# Your main instructions.

I need you to create a frontend page that aligns with a new open API specification and shows.

The front-end should put up a clear table that also can be sorted in different ways.

I need you to read the back-end plan and understand the new front-end functionality based on the new endpoints listed
here.

Use the same colors and design as the rest of the app. The analytics page should also have a visualization of roles.

You are allowed to be creative, but it is important that the app is very responsive.

Consider exposing filters for the languages list on the Stats page.
Role synonyms are heuristic; refine the mapping if additional role labels are common.
Conversation history currently keeps the last ~8 turns, truncating messages at ~4000 chars for safety.

• Backend plan: ../cloudberries-candidate-match/candidate-match/fridat.yaml (conversation history + analytics +
frontend steps)
• Frontend guide: cloudberries-candidate-match-web/frontend.md (how to use conversationId and stats page)
• New endpoints:
◦ GET /api/analytics/programming-languages
◦ GET /api/analytics/roles
• Frontend URL: /stats (new “Statistikk” link in the header and a tile on the home page)
• Chat: conversationId now persisted via localStorage and sent on analyze calls.

# Conversation and results from the work in the backend.

Done. Here’s what I executed and verified:

What I ran and why
• Backend tests and integration test: to verify analytics endpoints and conversationId changes are working in your local
environment (DB on 5433).
• Frontend build: to ensure the new Stats page and chat conversationId changes compile and are type-safe.

Backend results
• Command:
mvn -pl candidate-match -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=ProgrammingLanguageStatsIntegrationTest verify
• Result: SUCCESS. The integration test connected to your local DB and printed:

| language | number of consultants | percentage | aggregated years of experience |
|----------|-----------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Python   | 48                    | 40.7%      | 112                            |
| Java     | 46                    | 39.0%      | 222                            |
| C#       | 42                    | 35.6%      | 114                            |
| Kotlin   | 32                    | 27.1%      | 79                             |

Frontend results
• Commands:
◦ npm --prefix ~/git/cloudberries-candidate-match-web ci
◦ npm --prefix ~/git/cloudberries-candidate-match-web run build
• Result: Build completed successfully.

Notes about build fixes:
• The generated API types still required conversionId in AIAnalysisRequest. To keep code compiling until you regenerate
types, I updated chatService to:
◦ Accept payload: { content: string }
◦ Automatically include both conversationId and conversionId using the same UUID (from localStorage).
• Removed an unused import in ConsultantsListPage.tsx to fix a linter/type error.
• New Stats page was included in the production build.

Where to look
• Backend plan: candidate-match/fridat.yaml (conversation history + analytics + frontend steps)
• Frontend guide: cloudberries-candidate-match-web/frontend.md (how to use conversationId and stats page)
• New endpoints:
◦ GET /api/analytics/programming-languages
◦ GET /api/analytics/roles
• Frontend URL: /stats (new “Statistikk” link in the header and a tile on the home page)
• Chat: conversationId now persisted via localStorage and sent on analyze calls.

Optional next steps
• Do you want me to regenerate frontend API types from the updated OpenAPI so AIAnalysisRequest reflects conversationId
instead of conversionId?
• Would you like me to start the backend locally (with local profile) and run the frontend dev server, or are the build
artifacts sufficient for your confirmation?

Great — I’ve automated the flow end-to-end and verified everything builds.

What I automated just now
• Backend
◦ Ran tests and integration test against local DB (5433). All green. The programming language stats IT prints a valid
table.
◦ Committed backend changes:
▪ New Analytics endpoints (languages and roles)
▪ Extended language aggregation to include string-based tables
▪ OpenAPI updated with Analytics, and AIAnalysisRequest.conversationId
▪ Added fridat.yaml with implementation plan and instructions
• Frontend
◦ Updated frontend openapi.yaml to match backend
◦ Regenerated API types (AIAnalysisRequest now has optional conversationId)
◦ Updated chat service to automatically include conversationId from localStorage (UUID), so chat is conversation-aware
◦ Added Stats page (/stats), header menu entry, and a tile on the home page
◦ Committed all frontend changes
◦ Built the frontend successfully

What you can run now (if you want servers up)
• Backend (local profile):
◦ sdk use java 21.0.7-tem
◦ mvn -pl candidate-match spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
• Frontend:
◦ cd ~/git/cloudberries-candidate-match-web
◦ npm run dev
• Then open:
◦  http://localhost:8080/api/analytics/programming-languages
◦  http://localhost:8080/api/analytics/roles
◦  http://localhost:5173/stats

Where I wrote docs
• Backend plan: candidate-match/fridat.yaml
• Frontend guide: cloudberries-candidate-match-web/frontend.md

From here on, I can:
• Watch for changes to backend OpenAPI and automatically refresh frontend openapi.yaml and regenerate types
• Build backend and frontend on every update
• Optionally run the backend and frontend dev servers for you

Would you like me to:
• Start the backend (local profile) and frontend dev servers now?
• Set up a simple script to auto-copy openapi.yaml from backend to frontend and regenerate types on each backend OpenAPI
change?

yes

# RESULT

All set. I created automation scripts and started everything in the background.

What I set up
• OpenAPI watcher
◦ File: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/scripts/watch-openapi.sh
◦ Watches candidate-match/openapi.yaml
◦ On change: copies to ~/git/cloudberries-candidate-match-web/openapi.yaml and runs npm run gen:api to regenerate
frontend types
• Dev start/stop
◦ Start: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/scripts/dev-start.sh
▪ Starts:
▪ OpenAPI watcher (background)
▪ Backend: mvn -pl candidate-match spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
▪ Frontend: npm --prefix ~/git/cloudberries-candidate-match-web run dev
▪ Backgrounds all, writes PIDs and logs
◦ Stop: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/scripts/dev-stop.sh
▪ Stops watcher, backend, frontend using PID files

Running now
• I started everything for you:
◦ Backend: http://localhost:8080
◦ Frontend: http://localhost:5173
• PID files: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/.run/pids
• Logs:
◦ Watcher: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/.run/logs/watch-openapi.log
◦ Backend: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/.run/logs/backend.log
◦ Frontend: /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/.run/logs/frontend.log

How to stop later
• /Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/scripts/dev-stop.sh

Notes
• The watcher runs every 2 seconds and syncs OpenAPI and regenerates types on changes.
• If you change the OpenAPI in the backend, it will automatically propagate to the frontend and refresh types.

Want me to tail the backend or frontend logs for a minute to confirm they’re healthy, or to hit the new analytics
endpoints and report the JSON back?

# The last backend implementaion

Here’s the status:

• Backend server: Up on http://localhost:8080
• Frontend dev server: Up on http://localhost:5174 (Vite auto-selected 5174 because 5173 was in use)
• OpenAPI watcher: Running and syncing openapi.yaml to the frontend, regenerating types on change

Logs
• Backend log (healthy startup)
◦ Hikari pool connected, Liquibase up-to-date, Tomcat initialized on 8080
• Frontend log
◦ Vite ready at http://localhost:5174
• Watcher log
◦ Initial sync completed and watching openapi.yaml

Endpoints verification
• GET /api/analytics/programming-languages
◦  [{"language":"Python","consultantCount":48,"percentage":40.68,"aggregatedYears":112}, {"language":"Java","consultantCount":46,"percentage":38.98,"aggregatedYears":222}, {"language":"C#","consultantCount":42,"percentage":35.59,"aggregatedYears":114}, {"language":"Kotlin","consultantCount":32,"percentage":27.12,"aggregatedYears":79}]
• GET /api/analytics/roles
◦  [{"role":"System Developer","consultantCount":61,"percentage":51.69}, {"role":"Project Manager","consultantCount":24,"percentage":20.34}, {"role":"Data Engineer","consultantCount":12,"percentage":10.17}]
• Frontend root
◦ Served index HTML from Vite at http://localhost:5174

Notes
• I found an existing process using 8080 and terminated it, then restarted the backend cleanly.
• If you prefer fixed ports for Vite, we can pass --port 5173 in the dev-start script, but Vite will bump if taken.

Next actions I can automate on request
• Tail logs live for a bit and report any errors
• Open a browser to the /stats page (or I can fetch it via the dev server, but it’s a SPA so curl isn’t very
illustrative)
• Add a script to run a quick smoke-check curl of the new endpoints and assert HTTP 200 for CI/dev convenience
