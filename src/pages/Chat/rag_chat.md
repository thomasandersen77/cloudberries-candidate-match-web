What I added

1) “Recent consultants” local-history in the Autocomplete
    * When you pick a consultant, they are stored in localStorage (max 8), newest first.
    * When the search box is empty, the Autocomplete shows your recent consultants, so you can re-select quickly.
    * When you type, it merges recent entries with live search results (de-duplicated, recent first).

2) CV options dropdown (instead of free-text cvId)
    * After selecting a consultant, the UI fetches their CVs and renders a CV dropdown:
      **  Each option shows versionTag (or “default”), marks the active CV, and shows the quality score if available.
      **  You can still override by picking a different CV option from the dropdown.

3) Persist consultant and cvId selection per session
    * Session persistence for the chosen target:
      **  chat.target.userId
      **  chat.target.name
      **  chat.target.defaultCvId
      **  chat.target.cvId
    * On consultant change, we also load the CV list and default the CV dropdown to defaultCvId if present.

4) API spec improvements to support UX
    * Frontend + Backend OpenAPI updated:
      **  Added consultantId and cvId to ChatSearchRequest (documented and examples updated).
      **  Added GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs returning ConsultantCvDto[] (so the frontend can populate the CV
      dropdown).
    * Regenerated frontend types.

Files changed (highlights)

OpenAPI

* frontend: openapi.yaml
  **  Added ChatSearchRequest.consultantId and cvId
  **  Added new example “targeted”
  **  Added path /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs (returns ConsultantCvDto[])
* backend: candidate-match/openapi.yaml
  **  Mirrored the same additions so controllers can be updated accordingly

Frontend services/types

* src/api/generated.ts (regenerated)
* src/services/consultantsService.ts
  **  Added listConsultantCvs(userId)

Chat UI

* src/pages/Chat/ChatSearchTab.tsx
  **  Added Autocomplete for consultant with recent/local-history integration
  **  Added CV dropdown populated via listConsultantCvs
  **  Persisted consultant and cv selection to session
  **  Added mode chips (quick selectors)
  **  Persisted forceMode/topK in localStorage
  **  Updated payload to include consultantId and cvId if set

Build status

* npm run build: Success

How to try it

* npm run dev
* Navigate to /chat
* Use the “Konsulent” Autocomplete to search and select a name
* CV dropdown will load and default to their default CV
* Use the mode chips for quick mode switching; Top K is persisted
* Send query — request payload now includes consultantId/cvId when selected, enabling RAG with the chosen CV

What the backend needs to do

* Implement GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs to return the CV list (we added it to backend openapi.yaml)
* Update chat search handling so that when consultantId/cvId are provided:
  **  Retrieve the CV JSON
  **  Combine it with the prompt as context for the AI (especially for RAG)
  **  Continue using conversationId to maintain long-running context across turns

Optional next enhancements

* Show “Recent” group labels inside Autocomplete (currently merged at the top; we can group by section if you want).
* Persist the selected consultant and cv across sessions with expiry or “pin” favorite consultants.
* Add a “Use active CV” toggle to auto-pick the active CV even if versionTag changes over time.

# iteration two:

Done. I implemented all three requested enhancements and aligned the frontend even closer with your new backend RAG
implementation.

What I added

1) “⭐ Pinned” labels and grouping in the Autocomplete
    * Pinned consultants are now visually marked with a star in the list.
    * The Autocomplete groups options under:
      ** Favorites: pinned consultants
      ** Others: everything else (recent + live search results)
    * This makes favorites instantly recognizable and top-priority.

2) “Favorites” section header (grouping)
    * The dropdown has section headers via groupBy/renderGroup, so Favorites are separated clearly from other results.

3) “Remember selection” toggle (persist across sessions)
    * Added a small “Remember: ON/OFF” chip.
    * When ON, the last selected consultant (userId) and CV ID are persisted in localStorage:
      ** chat.rememberSelection = true/false
      ** chat.remember.userId = {userId}
      ** chat.remember.cvId = {cvId}
    * On load, if remember is ON:
      ** The UI tries to restore the last selected consultant from pinned or recent lists
      ** If not found locally, it calls GET /api/consultants/{userId} to fetch the summary
      ** Restores the CV ID as well

4) Behavior matching your backend RAG rules
    * “Send” is disabled if mode is RAG and no consultant is selected.
    * On send, the payload includes conversationId (if present), consultantId, and cvId when chosen.
    * This allows the backend to include the CV JSON for targeted context, and to maintain conversation state.

OpenAPI updates

* Added a new endpoint to help restore the remembered selection:
  ** GET /api/consultants/{userId} → ConsultantSummaryDto
* The CVs endpoint is already present:
  ** GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs → ConsultantCvDto[]
* Mirrored both additions in backend openapi.yaml so controllers can be kept in sync.
* Regenerated frontend types: npm run gen:api

Code changes (highlights)

* src/pages/Chat/ChatSearchTab.tsx
  ** Grouped Autocomplete with Favorites header
  ** renderOption adds “⭐” to pinned entries
  ** “Pin/Unpin” and “Clear recent” controls kept; added “Remember: ON/OFF” chip
  ** Restores last selection if remember is enabled (using pinned/recent or by fetching /api/consultants/{userId})
  ** CV dropdown populated via listConsultantCvs
  ** “Send” disabled for RAG without consultant
* src/services/consultantsService.ts
  ** Added getConsultantByUserId(userId) to support restoring remembered selection
  ** Kept listConsultantCvs(userId) typed to ConsultantCvDto[]
* openapi.yaml (frontend) and candidate-match/openapi.yaml (backend)
  ** Added GET /api/consultants/{userId}
  ** Verified existing GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs
* src/api/generated.ts regenerated accordingly

How to use

* npm run dev
* Go to /chat
* Favorites and Recent:
  ** Favorites (pinned) appear under “Favorites” header, with a ⭐
  ** “Clear recent” removes recent history; favorites remain
* Remember:
  ** Toggle “Remember: ON/OFF”
  ** When ON, the selection is restored on next session
* RAG:
  ** Must select a consultant to enable “Send”
  ** CV dropdown defaults to defaultCvId; can be changed

Notes

* The new GET /api/consultants/{userId} is included in both openapi.yaml files; ensure backend controllers expose it.
* If you’d like more grouping (e.g., show “Recent” as a separate section distinct from “Others”), I can split the logic
  into explicit “Favorites / Recent / Results” sections.

Would you like me to:

* Show a small badge for “active” CV in the CV dropdown item rather than plain text?
* Add an inline “X” to quickly unpin from the option line?
* Add a tooltip explaining what “Remember” stores and how to clear it?

# iteration three:

All set. I have aligned the frontend with your backend roadmap and enhanced the chat experience to make semantic and
hybrid (structured+semantic) searches trivial from natural language.

What I implemented

1) Natural-language semantic/hybrid search made easy
   • Sample query chips under the main prompt
   ◦ One click sets the prompt and preferred mode, no extra UI clutter
   ◦ Examples include your two and several more, tuned for typical use:
   ▪ “Gi meg 10 konsulenter som har minst 5 års erfaring med Kotlin, Spring Boot, Postgres og har jobbet i prosjekter i
   offentlig sektor” (HYBRID, topK=10)
   ▪ “Hvilke konsulenter bør jeg sende til et prosjekt hos SpareBank 1? De må kunne Java, Spring og må ha hatt
   arkitekt-roller” (HYBRID)
   ▪ “Fullstack React/Java i skyprosjekter”, “Data engineering (Kafka/Spark/GCP/Azure)”, “Kotlin backend senior”,
   “Python/ML”, “Arkitekt med betalingsløsninger”, “Team lead/mentor”
   ◦ Click a chip to set prompt + mode (SEMANTIC/HYBRID) and Top K; then click Send
   • ForceMode chips retained
   ◦ Auto / STRUCTURED / SEMANTIC / HYBRID / RAG
   ◦ RAG still requires selecting a consultant (see below)

2) RAG consultant targeting, CV selection, and “Use active CV”
   • Consultant selector dropdown
   ◦ Pinned favorites in a “Favorites” section header with ⭐ label
   ◦ Recent consultants merged with live search (de-duplicated), favorites always on top
   ◦ Clear recent button resets only recent history; favorites remain
   • CV dropdown for selected consultant
   ◦ Populated via GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs
   ◦ Shows versionTag (default if missing), “(active)” flag, and quality score
   • “Use active CV” toggle
   ◦ When enabled, the frontend omits cvId; backend will apply “use active CV if omitted”
   • Send is disabled if RAG is chosen and no consultant is selected (reflects your backend rule)

3) Remember last selection across sessions (explicit opt-in)
   • “Remember: ON/OFF” chip
   ◦ When ON, the UI persists last selected consultant userId and cvId
   ◦ On startup, it restores from pinned/recent if possible; otherwise calls GET /api/consultants/{userId} to fetch
   summary by ID
   ◦ Keys used in localStorage: chat.rememberSelection, chat.remember.userId, chat.remember.cvId

4) Conversation continuity
   • Conversation ID is maintained in sessionStorage and sent with requests
   • “Ny samtale” button clears and starts a fresh conversation on the server

5) OpenAPI additions to support the UX
   • Frontend + Backend openapi.yaml updated with:
   ◦ ChatSearchRequest includes consultantId and cvId (already implemented backend-side)
   ◦ GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs returns ConsultantCvDto[] (for CV dropdown)
   ◦ GET /api/consultants/{userId} returns ConsultantSummaryDto (for restoring remembered selection)

6) Small quality-of-life improvements in Chat UI
   • Mode chip for current server mode (from response) is shown inline
   • Top K persisted (localStorage)
   • Clear recent button next to favorites/pin controls
   • RAG source cards show score and quick links when available

Files changed (highlights)
• openapi.yaml (frontend) and candidate-match/openapi.yaml (backend)
◦ Added consultantId/cvId fields, new examples, and paths for consultant summary/CVs
• src/api/generated.ts regenerated (uppercase enums, new endpoints, new fields)
• src/services/consultantsService.ts
◦ listConsultantCvs(userId), getConsultantByUserId(userId)
• src/pages/Chat/ChatSearchTab.tsx
◦ Sample query chips, favorites grouping with ⭐ and grouping headers
◦ Use active CV toggle
◦ Remember selection chip with persistence
◦ Consultant/CV session/local storage sync
◦ Disable Send if RAG without consultant

Build status
• npm run build: Success

How this aligns with your backend plan
• Persist conversations (Redis/DB) — frontend continues to carry conversationId; server-side persistence is transparent
to the UI
• Chunk CVs + vector retrieval — transparent to the UI (the server picks the path)
• Use active CV when cvId omitted — implemented via “Bruk aktiv CV” toggle (omits cvId)

Semantic/hybrid search usage from frontend
• Enter free-form text in the prompt or click a sample chip
• Choose a mode (SEMANTIC or HYBRID)
• Set Top K as desired
• Click Send
• The backend can combine structured + semantic (HYBRID) and rank on semantic + CV score. The frontend keeps the UX
simple.

Notes
• If you later add hybrid weighting controls (e.g., similarity vs. CV score), I can add a slider and pass a field once
the API is extended.
• If you want a dedicated “Semantic” page focused on just natural-language consultant search results (without chat
context), I can wire a simple page using /api/consultants/search/semantic directly.

Would you like me to:
• Add a visual tag for “active CV” in the CV dropdown options?
• Add a small info tooltip describing “Remember” behavior and where to clear stored IDs?
• Add filter chips for optional “Only active CVs” or “Min CV score” when in HYBRID/STRUCTURED modes (once exposed in the
Chat API or via a separate semantic/structured page)?
