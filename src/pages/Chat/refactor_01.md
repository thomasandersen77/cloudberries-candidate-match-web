Thanks — I can refactor the Chat page to support the new AI-powered consultant search endpoint and related features.
Before I finalize the task description and delegate for execution planning, I need a few clarifications and I’ll
summarize the current repo context so we’re aligned.

# Open questions to refine intent

### Scope of the Chat page

* Should the existing “AI Chat Analyse” page at /chat be replaced by the new AI search experience, or should we add tabs
  to support both “Analyze” (current /api/chatbot/analyze) and “AI Search” (/api/chatbot/search) on the same page? Add
  tabs

### Controls to expose

* Do you want a “Force mode” control (auto vs structured/semantic/hybrid/rag) surfaced in the UI for
  debugging/verification? Yes
* Should Top K be configurable (default 10) on the chat search form? No
* Should we surface latency/timing and a collapsible “Debug” panel showing the AI interpretation (route, confidence,
  extracted criteria)? YES

### Conversation behavior

* Should we persist and reuse conversationId across user messages (sessionStorage/localStorage) and include a “New
  conversation” action? YES

## Results linking

* The new ChatSearchResponse.results items include consultantId (uuid) and name. Your existing detail routes use
  /consultants/:userId. Is consultantId equal to userId in your backend? If not, does SearchResult.meta already include
  userId and/or cvId so we can link to “Details” and “View full CV”? If neither, should we request the backend to
  include these in meta?

## RAG placeholder

* For “rag” mode, do you want a simple answer box + sources list (consultantName, location, score) with links to the
  consultant (if IDs are available), and a small “experimental” badge? YES
* Keep language and styling? YES
* Continue with Norwegian labels and current MUI look-and-feel? YES

# What I found in your repo (relevant context)

## OpenAPI spec (updated): openapi.yaml includes the new path and schemas

* /api/chatbot/search path and ChatSearchRequest/ChatSearchResponse are defined with examples
* Includes SearchResult (consultantId, name, score, highlights, meta), RAGSource, DebugInfo, QueryInterpretation,
  StructuredCriteria, ConfidenceScores

### Generated types missing chat search

* src/api/generated.ts currently does NOT include /api/chatbot/search or ChatSearch* schemas. Per README, regenerate
  types:
  ** npm run gen:api (writes to src/api/generated.ts)
* Type re-exports
* src/types/api.ts re-exports many schemas but not the new ChatSearch types. We should add:
* ChatSearchRequest, ChatSearchResponse, SearchResult, RAGSource, DebugInfo, QueryInterpretation, StructuredCriteria,
  ConfidenceScores? YES
* Services
* src/services/chatService.ts has analyzeContent() for /api/chatbot/analyze only. We’ll add a new function for chat
  search, e.g. searchChat(payload: ChatSearchRequest). YES

## Existing Chat page

* src/pages/Chat/ChatAnalyzePage.tsx is the current “AI Chat Analyse” UI (message bubbles against /api/chatbot/analyze).
  It persists messages in session storage and is routed at /chat (src/App.tsx).
* Existing search page (useful UI patterns to reuse)
* src/pages/Search/ConsultantSearchPage.tsx includes nice results tables and patterns for consultant listing, score
  rings, and navigation to details/CV. We can reuse the tabbed design ethos and table rendering for
  structured/semantic/hybrid result rendering in the Chat page’s answer area. YES

## Proposed deliverables and acceptance criteria

* Types and services
* Regenerate OpenAPI types so /api/chatbot/search and ChatSearch* are available.
* Update src/types/api.ts to re-export ChatSearch types.
* Add searchChat() service that POSTs to /api/chatbot/search and returns typed ChatSearchResponse.
* Chat page refactor
* Option A (single page with tabs): Convert /chat into a two-tab experience: “AI Search” (new) and “Analyze” (existing).
* Option B (replace): Replace /chat with the new AI search experience and optionally move Analyze to /chat/analyze (
  route update).
* Chat search UI
* Input: multiline text, optional Force mode selector (auto/structured/semantic/hybrid/rag), optional Top K control. NO
  NOT Top K control yet
* Conversation: persist conversationId (returned in response) and include in subsequent requests; “New conversation”
  button to reset. YES
* Results rendering:
* structured/semantic/hybrid: list SearchResult items with name, score (0–1 → show as %), highlights; action buttons to
  “Se detaljer” and “Se hele CV” if we can map IDs.
* rag: show answer text and sources list (consultantName, location, score); link to consultant if we have IDs. YES
* Diagnostics: show mode used, latency; optional collapsible “Debug details” panel with route, confidence, extracted
  criteria, semanticText, consultantName, question, and timings. YES
* Loading/error states: delayed spinner for longer operations; clear error messages with retry. YES
* Mobile-friendly: keep current MUI patterns and sizing responsiveness. YES

## Linking behavior

* If consultantId = userId or present in meta, wire “Se detaljer” → /consultants/:userId and “Se hele CV” → /cv/:userId.
  Otherwise, fall back to rendering without links and raise a follow-up to include IDs in meta. YES

## Tests

* Basic render tests for the new Chat tab, search submission, and result display. YES
* Optional: snapshot of debug panel layout. YES BOTH IF POSSIBLE

## Assumptions if you don’t specify otherwise

* We’ll add a Force mode dropdown and Top K numeric field to the AI Search panel. NOT Top K numeric field
* We’ll show a collapsible “Debug details” section for developer visibility. YES
* We’ll persist conversationId per browser session and provide a “Ny samtale” button. YES
* We’ll keep Norwegian labels and match the current styling.

## Please confirm:

* Replace /chat or add tabs to keep “Analyze” alongside “AI Search”? KEEP
* Expose Force mode and Top K? YES BUT NOT Top K numeric field
* Persist conversation and add “New conversation”? YES
* Confirm consultantId mapping to userId (or that userId/cvId are in SearchResult.meta). If not, should backend include
  them? YES
* OK to show debug info (route, confidence, extracted criteria) in a collapsible panel? YES

### Once I have your answers, I’ll produce the final task description and hand it off for execution planning.

Great — thanks for the clear answers. I’ll proceed with a tabbed Chat page that keeps the existing Analyze experience
and adds the new AI Search, with Force mode (no Top K control), conversation persistence, a collapsible Debug panel,
loaders/spinners, and long timeouts.

Here’s the final task description I’ll execute, plus the exact repo context I used.

Task: Refactor Chat into a two-tab page with AI Search using /api/chatbot/search
Overview
• Add a tabbed Chat page at /chat with two tabs:
◦ AI-søk: new natural-language consultant search via POST /api/chatbot/search
◦ Analyser: existing /api/chatbot/analyze UI preserved as-is
• Expose “Force mode” (Auto/Structured/Semantic/Hybrid/RAG). Do not expose Top K (use backend default).
• Persist conversationId in sessionStorage; include it in requests; add Ny samtale to reset conversation.
• Show loaders with a delayed spinner (500 ms threshold) and use long timeout (5 min) for chat search requests.
• Render results:
◦ structured/semantic/hybrid: list SearchResult with name, score as percent, highlights; link to /consultants/:userId
and /cv/:userId if userId resolvable (prefer meta.userId; else fall back to consultantId). If not resolvable, disable
links with a tooltip.
◦ rag: show answer text and sources (consultantName, location, score), “Eksperimentell” badge, and links if userId
resolvable.
• Show latency and a collapsible Debug panel (interpretation, confidence, timings, and a raw JSON section).
• Tests: unit tests for tabs, submit flow, rag rendering, debug, Ny samtale, delayed spinner, error handling, and helper
utilities.

Acceptance criteria
• /chat shows two tabs. Analyze behavior unchanged.
• AI-søk tab sends POST /api/chatbot/search with { text, forceMode? (omit when Auto), conversationId? } and no topK.
• Long timeout used for AI search; delayed spinner appears only after 500 ms.
• Results render per mode; links enabled only when we can resolve userId.
• Latency is displayed; Debug panel shows interpretation, confidence, and timings.
• ConversationId is persisted and cleared by Ny samtale.
• Tests pass for the scenarios above and no regressions to other pages.

Planned changes

1) Types and codegen
   • Run npm run gen:api so src/api/generated.ts includes /api/chatbot/search and ChatSearch* schemas.
   • Update src/types/api.ts to re-export:
   ◦ ChatSearchRequest, ChatSearchResponse, SearchResult, RAGSource, DebugInfo, QueryInterpretation, StructuredCriteria,
   ConfidenceScores.

2) Service
   • Extend src/services/chatService.ts:
   ◦ Add searchChat(payload: ChatSearchRequest): Promise<ChatSearchResponse>.
   ◦ Use aiScoringClient (5-minute timeout) from src/services/apiClient.ts.
   ◦ Keep analyzeContent unchanged.

3) UI refactor
   • Extract current Analyze UI to src/pages/Chat/ChatAnalyzeTab.tsx (moved from ChatAnalyzePage).
   • Create src/pages/Chat/ChatSearchTab.tsx:
   ◦ Controls: multiline TextField for text; Force mode Select (Auto/Structured/Semantic/Hybrid/RAG); Send; Ny samtale.
   ◦ State: input text, isSubmitting, showSpinner (after 500 ms), conversationId (sessionStorage key e.g.,
   chat.search.conversationId), response, error, latency, debug open/closed.
   ◦ Submit: build payload with text, optional forceMode (omit for Auto), optional conversationId; call searchChat;
   update UI with mode, latency, debug, results.
   ◦ Results:
   ▪ Non-RAG: render name, score (0–1 → percent), highlights; “Se detaljer” and “Se hele CV” buttons if userId
   resolvable.
   ▪ RAG: show answer text, “Eksperimentell” chip, and list sources with location, score and links when possible.
   ◦ Debug panel: collapsible MUI Accordion with interpretation (route, semanticText, structured), confidence, timings,
   and a raw JSON dump of debug.extra.
   ◦ Error handling: Alert with retry.
   ◦ Mobile responsive using patterns from the Search page.
   • New container: src/pages/Chat/ChatPage.tsx with Tabs “AI-søk” and “Analyser” that render ChatSearchTab and
   ChatAnalyzeTab.
   • Routing: in src/App.tsx route /chat to ChatPage.

4) Helpers
   • New src/utils/chat.ts:
   ◦ DELAYED_SPINNER_MS = 500
   ◦ CHAT_SEARCH_CONV_KEY = 'chat.search.conversationId'
   ◦ formatScoreToPercent(score0to1)
   ◦ resolveUserId(result): meta.userId || result.consultantId || undefined
   ◦ buildConsultantLink(userId) → /consultants/:userId
   ◦ buildCvLink(userId) → /cv/:userId
   • Add TODO calling out that backend should include userId and cvId in SearchResult.meta for robust linking, if not
   already aligned.

5) Tests
   • src/pages/Chat/tests/ChatPage.test.tsx:
   ◦ Renders tabs and switches.
   ◦ Happy path (structured): mocks searchChat; verifies result row with name and percent score; confirms links enabled
   when userId resolvable.
   ◦ RAG: verifies answer rendering, chip, and sources list.
   ◦ Debug: toggles accordion and checks interpretation/confidence/timings.
   ◦ Ny samtale: verifies conversationId clear from sessionStorage and UI reset.
   ◦ Spinner: fake timers to assert 500 ms delayed spinner.
   ◦ Error: mock rejected promise; Alert appears; retry works.
   • Utilities tests for resolveUserId and that Auto omits forceMode; asserts topK is never sent; confirms
   conversationId included when present.

Commands to run (informational, I won’t run them now)
• npm run gen:api
• npm run test
• npm run dev

Repo context I used
• openapi.yaml
◦ /api/chatbot/search path and ChatSearch* schemas
• src/api/generated.ts
◦ Current file exists; missing ChatSearch until types are regenerated
• package.json
◦ “gen:api”: openapi-typescript openapi.yaml -o src/api/generated.ts
• src/types/api.ts
◦ Re-exports current OpenAPI types; will add ChatSearch types
• src/services/apiClient.ts
◦ aiScoringClient with 300000 ms timeout for long AI calls
• src/services/chatService.ts
◦ analyzeContent() for /api/chatbot/analyze; will add searchChat()
• src/pages/Chat/ChatAnalyzePage.tsx
◦ Existing Analyze UI; to be moved to ChatAnalyzeTab
• src/App.tsx
◦ /chat currently points to ChatAnalyzePage; will point to ChatPage
• UI patterns for list rendering, spinners, and delayed loading:
◦ src/pages/Search/ConsultantSearchPage.tsx and tests/e2e for reference

Notes and assumptions
• No Top K control in UI; rely on backend default.
• Force mode “Auto” means omit forceMode from the request.
• Link resolution prefers meta.userId, else consultantId; if neither, links disabled and a tooltip clarifies.
• Norwegian labels and MUI styling throughout.
• Long timeout ensured via aiScoringClient; delayed spinner improves perceived responsiveness.

Would you like me to proceed with these changes now?
